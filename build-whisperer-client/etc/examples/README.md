This allows you to run some custom examples of the build-whisperer at work.

Before you run an example, you need to first execute:
	
	"gradle clean install shadowJar".

Once that build process has successfully completed you can run an example by executing:
	
	"runExample.bat <example-directory>"

For example:
	
	"runExample.bat json-to-log"
